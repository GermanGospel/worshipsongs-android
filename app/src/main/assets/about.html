<h1>About</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This app brings you most of the Praise & Worship lyrics used by Tamil churches all over the world. Now, you can worship anytime, anywhere with all the lyrics you need.
</p>

<h3>Why Worship Songs?</h3>

<p>
Why develop another app when there are tons of similar apps? The short answer is: There are no similar apps.
Worship Songs was developed as we couldn't find an app with latest Praise & Worship songs with both Tamil and Romanised text. So, Worship Songs is the world's first mobile app that offers Romanised text for Tamil lyrics. Many Tamil congregations also sing English songs. Worship Songs provides many popular English songs as well so you need not look for another app. And finally, the songs database evolves rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song. Did we mention that Worship Songs is open source? Yes, you can be a part of this project. Isn't that great?
